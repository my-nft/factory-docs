This depend on the blockchain you are willing to use for your project.
Make sure to start with a test network to avoid spending real funds.
#### Test networks
These are parallel blockchains to allow you test your environnement in conditions similaire to productions.

There are many test networks available depending on the blockchain you aim to use.
For Ethereum you have many testnets: Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, ... and they are all supported by our platform.

For Binance Smart Chain you can use Binance Smart Chain Testnet.
#### Main networks
Once you are done validating your project on a testnet, it is time to move to the mainnet of your choice.

At MyNFT we support all the EVM compatible blockchains.
Here is a non exhaustive list of supported blockchains:

1. Ethereum
2. Binance Smart Chain
3. Polygon
4. Avalanche
5. ...

If you don't see the network you want in metamask you have two choices:

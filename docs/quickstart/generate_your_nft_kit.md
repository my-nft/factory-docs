Make sure to start with a test network to avoid spending real funds.
#### Test networks
These are parallel blockchains to allow you test your environnement in conditions similaire to productions.

There are many test networks available depending on the blockchain you aim to use.

For Ethereum you have many testnets: Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, ... and they are all supported by our platform.

For Binance Smart Chain you can use Binance Smart Chain Testnet.
#### Main networks
Once you are done validating your project on a testnet, it is time to move to the mainnet of your choice.

At MyNFT we support all the EVM compatible blockchains.
Here is a non exhaustive list of supported blockchains:

1. Ethereum
2. Binance Smart Chain
3. Polygon
4. Avalanche
5. ...

#### Add a new blockchain to metamask
If you don't see the network you want in metamask you have two choices:

1. The network is hidden, which is most of the time the case for Ethereum testnets. <a href="https://devtonight.com/articles/metamask-testnet-wallet-setup-for-blockchain-development" target="_blank">Here</a> is how to display Ethereum testnets in Metamask (go to 'Add Testnets To MetaMask').
2. The network is not configured in metamask. In this case, you can use this <a href="https://rpc.info/" target="_blank">tool</a> to add the desired metwork to metamask.

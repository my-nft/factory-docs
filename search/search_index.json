Make sure to start with a test network to avoid spending real funds. Test networks These are parallel blockchains to allow you test your environment in conditions similar to productions. There are many test networks available depending on the blockchain you aim to use. For Ethereum, you have many testnets: Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, ... and they are all supported by our platform. For Binance Smart Chain you can use Binance Smart Chain Testnet. Main networks Once you are done validating your project on a testnet, it is time to move to the mainnet of your choice. At MyNFT, we support all the EVM compatible blockchains. Here is a non-exhaustive list of supported blockchains: Ethereum Binance Smart Chain Polygon Avalanche ... Add a new blockchain to metamask If you don't see the network you want in metamask you have two choices: The network is hidden, which is most of the time the case for Ethereum testnets. Here is how to display Ethereum testnets in Metamask (go to Add Testnets To MetaMask ). The network is not configured in metamask. In this case, you can use this tool to add the desired network to metamask. Feed your wallet with test cryptos To start using our platform on a testnet, you will need test cryptos. You can get some for free depending on the network you are planning to use here. Now that your metamask wallet is set, you can create you first NFT Kit! Fill-in the form fields This is an easy part. All you have to do is to fill-in for fields and click on \"generate NFT Kit\" button. In the factory page you have to fill-in the following fields: NFT Collection Name This is the name of your NFT collection. You can't change this one later, so chose it carefully. It will be displayed in the blockchain explorer as well as in secondary NFT marketplaces as collection name. Some marketplaces allow to change this name afterward. This will only change the display, but in the blockchain, the name will remain the same. NFT Collection Symbol This is a second blockchain identifier for your collection. Choose this one carefully too because you won't be able to change it later, and it will be displayed in the blockchain explorer. Total supply This is the total number of NFTs to ever be minted from the collections. You can't change this one later as well. Click on \"Generate NFT Kit\" When you click on \"Generate NFT Kit\", your metamask wallet will pop up and ask you sign a transaction. This transaction will have a total cost from the following two components: Gas fees: this is the fee you should pay to the blockchain network to add your transaction in a block and validate it MyNFT fees: this is the fee you pay for using the factory . It is used to maintain the platform and build new features Stay in the page and wait for the transaction to be validated. DON'T USE the speed up OPTION IN METAMASK AFTER YOU SUBMIT THE TRANSACTION! Once the transaction validated you will receive a pop-up message, click on ok . This will finalise the NFT Kit configuration. NB: In case the factory keeps hanging during the NFT Kit configuration, or during the transaction validation, don't panic just contact the support at support@my-nft.io, and we will help you get your environment quickly.","title":"Generate your NFT Kit"},{"location":"quickstart/generate_your_nft_kit/#connect-metamask-to-the-right-network","text":"If you didn't configure your Metamask wallet yet, this tutorial will help you do so Connect Metamask to the right network This depends on the blockchain you are willing to use for your project.
